Who Are We?
===========
We are a group of highly energetic software developers, college students, and engineers passionate about fostering the next generation of problem solvers to be the super heroes of tomorrow.

What do you do?
==============
We do for coding what little league does for baseball. We run epic robotics and coding classes through partnerships with community education programs in Minnesota with all of the excitement of a sport. Here's a  video of one of our robotics classes.

I love working with kids and STEM! Can I help you?
=============
Probably! Even when we don't have openings, we're always looking to get in touch with potential future instructors for our coding and robotics classes! Tell us about yourself here!

Why aren't you in my town yet?
=============
We had to start somewhere. We're from the southwest metro, so we started there. We're currently expanding like crazy in Minnesota. If you want us in your town, get in touch and let us know!
