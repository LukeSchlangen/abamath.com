## Contributing to this Project

That would be amazing! We're currently in the middle of a substantial conversion from AngularJS 1.2 to Gatsby/React. If you're interested in contributing, we'd recommend going through this [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) first.

After that, we'd love your Pull Requests!

## Naming Conventions
    Always use a hyphen for your file names. We want to appear in google searches, and the google engine treats hyphens as word separators, but not underscores.

    All the code should not be capitalized, expect for exceptions like README.md

    Images should go to the images folder
