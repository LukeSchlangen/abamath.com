w<span>ww.</span>Abamath.com is way for children to get fun and engaging experience with technology, robotics, and coding!

Who Are We?
===========
We are a group of highly energetic software developers, college students, and engineers passionate about fostering the next generation of problem solvers to be the super heroes of tomorrow.

What do you do?
==============
We do for coding what little league does for baseball. We run epic robotics and coding classes through partnerships with community education programs in Minnesota with all of the excitement of a sport. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/0JSgVT5kgZI?autoplay=1&rel=0) of one of our robotics classes.

I love working with kids and STEM! Can I help you?
=============
Probably! Even when we don't have openings, we're always looking to get in touch with potential future instructors for our coding and robotics classes! Tell us about yourself [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd56ChwSSFvfJ__vrqgv4TLy4KlDqcvwBT8APvWfrRT1o8Mxg/viewform)!

Why aren't you in my town yet?
=============
We had to start somewhere. We're from the southwest metro, so we started there. We're currently expanding like crazy in Minnesota. If you want us in your town, [get in touch](mailto:info@abamath.com) and let us know!
