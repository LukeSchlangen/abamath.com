## Naming Conventions

* Always use a hyphen for your file names. We want to appear in google searches, and the google engine treats hyphens as word separators, but not underscores.
* Variable names should be camel case. For example, `thisisavariablename` should be `thisIsAVariableName`.

## File Organization

* Images should go into the images folder at src/images, preferably png
* Use gatsby-images plugin when using images
