            <ul> 
                <li>Example: “We are taking a break in TWO minutes!”</li>
                <li>Example: “When I say go you’re going to stand up, push in your chair, and line up 
                    at the door. From there, we are going to take a bathroom break as a class followed
                     by our 15 to 20 minute break outside.” Before giving your ‘go’ signal, pause a moment
                      to let their mental movie play out. Then challenge your class. “Is there anyone who 
                      doesn’t know exactly what to do when I say go?” Then pause yet again. </li>
                      </ul>
        <p>Way to get attention:</p>
                    <ul>

                    <li>Say, “1 2 3, eyes on me” and they respond, “1 2, eyes on you”</li> 
                    <li>With the younger kids, have them make mouth bubbles/”put a marshmallow 
                        in your mouth” where the kids inflate their cheeks. It gets their attention 
                        and stops them from talking over you</li>
                    <li>What color are my eyes/glasses/etc.?</li> 
                    <li>“If you hear me clap once… If you hear me clap twice… If you hear my clap three
                         times…” </li>
                    <li>Count backwards from 4</li>
                    <li>Have students stand and stretch, then sit and get started </li>
                    <li>“The noise level so far has cost us two minutes of break time.” 
                        Then hold up the number of minutes they have lost and wait for the 
                        silence, adding more minutes if it continues a long time. </li> 
                    <li>Flash lights </li> 
                    <li> For elementary schoolers, if you say X, they say Y</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>“All on board → Aye aye captain!” (kids can salute)</li>
                            <li>“Ready to rock → Ready to roll!” (kids can fist pump)</li>
                            <li>“Are you ready? → I was born ready!” (kids can make karate pose)</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Do what I do / Simon says: Have students continue to do what you do until you 
                        have all of their attention (pat head, rub stomach, tap ears, etc) </li>

            <p>How to Transition a Class</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simple Procedure</li> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Secure students’ attention: “Focus on me please” </li>
                        <li>Explain the procedure: “In a moment, we are going to transition to 
                            break time.”</li>
                        <li>Prepare kids for the signal to start: “When I say ‘smooth,’ you’ll 
                            quietly proceed.” </li>
                        <li>Initiate the transition: “And...smooth.” Don’t say ‘go’ because that 
                            word cues students to race. </li>
                        <li>Observe: Watch to make sure all students are complying. </li>

                        </ul>

                    <li>Slowly counting down from five never fails to accelerate transitions. </li>
                    <li>Right before a transition, ask a student to describe the proper transition
                         procedure. </li>
                    <li>Play “correct the teacher” and perform examples and nonexamples of behavior
                         while the students indicate if something is wrong by putting a thumbs down. 
                         Then call on someone to articulate the right procedure. </li>
                    <li>When students don’t want to quit what they’re doing, it’s probably because 
                        they felt blindsided. This can be corrected and prevented by having a visible
                         countdown timer as well as verbal reminders of when transitions will happen. </li>
                    <li>You could play a song like “I like to move it, move it” to signal that it is
                         time to change activities. </li>
                    <li>Give students a time limit for transitions</li>
                    <li>When transitioning back to the classroom, stop at the drinking fountain and 
                        bathroom first so that they have that time to calm down before walking back 
                        into the classroom. </li>
                    </ul>
            <p>A kid having a bad attitude the whole class</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First, tell them you will take away privileges, like computer time, break time, 
                        talking to their parents, or talking to another school official/camp official. </li>
                    <li>If the situation worsens, then start to follow through on taking these privileges
                         away and/or contacting their parents or a school official/camp official.</li>
                    <li>Take a break chair - Not a timeout, because the time doesn’t matter. The point 
                        is to allow the student to take time to think about why they needed a break. 
                        When they come back, they need to discuss what ideas they have to help them 
                        stay a part of the class and stay on task. </li>
                    <li>Deep Breaths</li>
                    <li>Coloring</li>
                    <li>Red/Green Card - A student needs to ask if they would like to talk by turning 
                        the card to green. The instructor can give the student the floor or turn the 
                        card back to red (can use a playing card if that is easier/on hand)</li>
