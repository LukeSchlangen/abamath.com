# Polices and Strategies 
## Behavior Policies
### Important teaching concepts that will help in the classroom 
    1.  Preview the class 
        - Example: “We are taking a break in TWO minutes!”
        - Example: “When I say go you’re going to stand up, push in your chair, and line up at the door. From there, we are going to take a bathroom break as a class followed by our 15 to 20 minute break outside.” Before giving your ‘go’ signal, pause a moment to let their mental movie play out. Then challenge your class. “Is there anyone who doesn’t know exactly what to do when I say go?” Then pause yet again. 
    2. Way to get attention:
        - Say, “1 2 3, eyes on me” and they respond, “1 2, eyes on you”
        - With the younger kids, have them make mouth bubbles/”put a marshmallow in your mouth” where the kids inflate their cheeks. It gets their attention and stops them from talking over you
        - What color are my eyes/glasses/etc.?
        - “If you hear me clap once… If you hear me clap twice… If you hear my clap three times…” 
        - Count backwards from 4
        - Have students stand and stretch, then sit and get started 
        - “The noise level so far has cost us two minutes of break time.” Then hold up the number of minutes they have lost and wait for the silence, adding more minutes if it continues a long time. 
        - Flash lights
        - For elementary schoolers, if you say X, they say Y
            - “All on board → Aye aye captain!” (kids can salute)
            - “Ready to rock → Ready to roll!” (kids can fist pump)
            - “Are you ready? → I was born ready!” (kids can make karate pose)
        - Do what I do / Simon says: Have students continue to do what you do until you have all of their attention (pat head, rub stomach, tap ears, etc) 
    3. How to transition a class 
        Simple procedure: 
            - Secure students’ attention: “Focus on me please” 
            - Explain the procedure: “In a moment, we are going to transition to break time.”
            - Prepare kids for the signal to start: “When I say ‘smooth,’ you’ll quietly proceed.” 
            - Initiate the transition: “And...smooth.” Don’t say ‘go’ because that word cues students to race. 
            - Observe: Watch to make sure all students are complying. 
        Slowly counting down from five never fails to accelerate transitions. 
    Right before a transition, ask a student to describe the proper transition procedure. 
Play “correct the teacher” and perform examples and nonexamples of behavior while the students indicate if something is wrong by putting a thumbs down. Then call on someone to articulate the right procedure. 
When students don’t want to quit what they’re doing, it’s probably because they felt blindsided. This can be corrected and prevented by having a visible countdown timer as well as verbal reminders of when transitions will happen. 
You could play a song like “I like to move it, move it” to signal that it is time to change activities. 
Give students a time limit for transitions
When transitioning back to the classroom, stop at the drinking fountain and bathroom first so that they have that time to calm down before walking back into the classroom. 
A kid having a bad attitude the whole class 
First, tell them you will take away privileges, like computer time, break time, talking to their parents, or talking to another school official/camp official. 
If the situation worsens, then start to follow through on taking these privileges away and/or contacting their parents or a school official/camp official.
Take a break chair - Not a timeout, because the time doesn’t matter. The point is to allow the student to take time to think about why they needed a break. When they come back, they need to discuss what ideas they have to help them stay a part of the class and stay on task.
Deep Breaths
Coloring
Red/Green Card - A student needs to ask if they would like to talk by turning the card to green. The instructor can give the student the floor or turn the card back to red (can use a playing card if that is easier/on hand)
Swearing or inappropriate comments 
First incident: Warning. Let them know that those words may be okay in a different setting, but not this one. 
Second incident: Warning with note or call home 
Tips:
“We don’t talk like that to each other.” 
“In this classroom we use formal language. The word you used is considered a swear room in my classroom and I don’t want to hear it again.” 
Ask them a different way to express their thought
“Language please!”
How do we handle a child's misuse of the internet? 
*** Use as a guideline! Situations may vary, especially with kids who have ADHD or other conditions, so make sure to account for those factors ***
Less severe 
First incident: warning
Second incident: warning with note or call home 
Third incident: warning with note or call home 
Fourth incident: termination of class 
More severe 
First incident: warning with note or call home
Second incident: termination of class 
What do we do if it does seem like one kid is being bullied? What if separating them doesn't help? 
https://www.smartclassroommanagement.com/2011/06/25/bullying-in-the-classroom/ 
Know what bullying is: “Bullying is the strong preying upon the weak. It can be a physical advantage or a social advantage. It can be one student or many. It often takes the form of threats, intimidation, repeated cruelty, and/or forcing someone against his or her will to do what the bully wants.” 
Separate bully from those bullied immediately: “Once you’re clear on the facts of the incident, and know who is responsible, act immediately. Separate the bully or bullies from their classmates in an in-class time-out. Tell them why, but don’t lecture, scold, raise your voice, or even ask for a response.” 
Speak to the bully’s parents and the victim’s parents. 
Keep a close eye on both the bully and the victim for the rest of the week. 
What if a child is not at all interested? (Ex. Just wants to sit in the corner and read) 
Really tough to answer. Situational. Ideally, finding something the student can be excited by. At end of first day, discussing with parent.
These kids will have phones. What if there is a prolonged amount of use on them? 
Only allowed use during breaks
It may be best to have a strategy of collecting phones at the beginning of class and then returning them during breaks. Luke is okay with requiring the student to give up their phone if they are unable to refrain from using it. 

## Parent Policies
What if a parent is being a bother? What if they want to sit in and watch us teach? 
For safety reasons, I would suggest no parents are allowed to sit in and watch unless Luke is present. Someone needs to be around to “escort” him or her, and with an instructor teaching, that would leave us out of that position to do so. We never know what kind of dangers or situations could arise from a parent. We can kindly tell them that there is an opportunity to see what their child is doing on Thursday when they can come in and see what they did. Also tell them that it is for safety purposes that they cannot sit in. 
Alternative answer: Let them stay for 30 minutes tops. From my own experience, I feel uncomfortable when a parents tries to watch me teach. It feels like they are stepping on my toes and like I no longer have authority over the class (could be an age thing). 

## Checkout Policies
Site for check ins: https://abamath-check-in.herokuapp.com/#!/
At the beginning of class, you should know/ask a district official how the check-in/checkout system of the district works. Some districts have a camp system that will determine where you pick up and drop off the kids.
For districts without a camp system, the kids will most likely be dropped off in the classroom by the parents. You should determine by the first parent where you will drop off the kids/have them picked up in the classroom to keep consistency for the remaining parents. 
At the end of the day, you must make sure the students’ spaces are clean.
If the parents pick up the child in the classroom, you and the other instructor(s) wait for every child to be picked up from the classroom
If you walk the kids to a designated area, make sure you and the other instructor(s) walk the kids to that location together. You and the other instructor(s) must stay and watch to make sure every child gets picked up by the correct car.

If we have a bad feeling about who is picking a child up.
Parents should have to sign their child in and out unless they write a note with their signature saying otherwise. To pick up a child, a parent or guardian should have their ID (remind them of this when they drop off their kid), and on our roster we should have a list of eligible pick-up people. If someone comes in and tries to pick up their child and their name is not on the list, we call someone who is on the list to confirm if it is okay or not. Instructor or parent then writes down the time the child arrives and leaves. This could be helpful for legal reasons if we are blamed for something during a time we were not in charge of the kid. Safety should be our number one priority and although it may be more of a hassle for parents and us as well, I think they will appreciate our attention to detail and safety in doing so. 
Get a school official, if necessary. It is always safe to have multiple people involved in a situation like this.
Definitely call police if we have a bad feeling about someone picking a child up. If you have a co-instructor, ask for their judgment on the situation as well before calling. 

## Emergency Policies
First aid? 
I think CPR/First Aid training would be a good investment for this company to make with their instructors. It’s possible some people have an up-to-date certification already. I believe it’s as crucial as running a background check. 
First aid examples
Tweezers - use to take out splinters or bee stingers 
Ice pack - use if a child is complaining of a pain or after they get stung by a bee 
Bandaids - use for minor scrapes and bumps 
Hydrocortisone - use for minor pains, swelling, itching, and discomfort 
Emergency situations - if there was a fire, tornado, etc., do we have a roster of the kids? 
Typically, rosters can be found on Eleyo. Every instructor should print a hard copy roster of their class with names, allergies/important information, emergency contact information, and parents/guardian names before the class starts. 
In case of a fire, escort your class to a safe location and count your kids / check your roster when you arrive. Let someone know if you don’t have your whole class. Never leave the kids alone. By having parents sign their child in and out, we can quickly see if a child didn’t come that day or if they are indeed somewhere else. 
In case of a tornado, escort your class to a safe location and count your kids / check your roster when you arrive. Let someone know if you don’t have your whole class. Never leave the kids alone. By having parents sign their child in and out, we can quickly see if a child didn’t come that day or if they are indeed somewhere else. 
In case of an active shooter situation, your best option is leave the building and don’t be a sitting duck. Getting away from the shooter or shooters is top priority. Leave everything except your roster behind. Help other escape, if possible, but evacuate regardless of if others agree to follow. Prevent your class from going where the active shooter may be. Call 911 when you are safe. 
If leaving isn’t an option, hide. Tell your class to stay very quiet and ensure that all phones are off and won’t vibrate. Lock and block doors, close blinds, and turn off the lights. Don’t hide in groups; spread out along wall or hide separately to make it harder for the shooter. Try to communicate silently with the police by sending a text or tagging your location on social media. Stay in place until you get the all clear from officials. 
Lost child procedure?
Hasn’t happened. Immediate outreach to community education. Could depend on how/when it happened. 

## Other Policies
Bathroom procedures and rules
Try to bring the whole group during designated break time (at least one every 90 minutes).
If there are 2 instructors and it’s not break time, one instructor can ask for a bathroom call. Always bring more than one child even if only one has to go. If it’s an emergency and it’s only you, bring the whole class. 
Never go into a stall with a child, even with it unlocked. 
Shouldn’t be a problem with our age groups, but if a younger child is having a hard time zipping or buttoning their pants, try to talk them through it. If there is an absolute need for help, have another adult be a spotter. This could help in legal situations. 
What do we do with extra time? 
Typically extend free work time, or look to ICE plans

## Printing Policy
Who prints: The person in charge of printing will be assigned for the summer
Where to print: The printing person may choose a location to print (ie local library or FedEx/OfficeMax), location should be used consistently
One-time prints: For one time prints (eg a new activity/curriculum update), email the document and number of copies needed to the printing person. These will be distributed at Team Tuesday meeting
Recurring prints(eg end of class handouts/flyers): 
Strategy 1: Each week, on Friday, instructors should email the printing person with the documents they need and the number of copies(based on their roster and including copies for potential last minute adds). These will be distributed on Team Tuesday
Strategy 2: Have the printing person do the work outlined above for all instructors for the week
