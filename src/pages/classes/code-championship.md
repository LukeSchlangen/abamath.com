Minnesota Code Championship is a one-day event for students from 3rd to 8th grade to learn and engage with computer code. To keep an even playing field, the details of the game are kept secret until the day of the championship. On the day of the championship, students will create an artificial intelligence computer bot to play head to head against other bots in a tournament.
